            <h3>What if Fertilizer?</h3>
            <p>A fertilizer (American English) or fertiliser (British English; see spelling differences) 
                is any material of natural or synthetic origin (other than liming materials) 
                that is applied to soil or to plant tissues to supply one or more plant nutrients 
                essential to the growth of plants.
                Many sources of fertilizer exist, both natural and industrially produced.</p>

            <h3>What is the need of Fertilizers?</h3>
            <p class="auto-style3">Fertilizers enhance the growth of plants. This goal is met in two ways, the traditional one being additives
                that provide nutrients. The second mode by which some fertilizers act is to enhance the effectiveness of the soil by modifying 
                its water retention and aeration. This article, like many on fertilizers, emphasises the nutritional aspect. Fertilizers typically
                provide, in varying proportions: </p>
            <p class="auto-style4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

three main macronutrients:
</p>
            <p class="auto-style2">Nitrogen (N): leaf growth
</p>
            <p class="auto-style2">Phosphorus (P): Development of roots, flowers, seeds, fruit;</p>
            <p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;Potassium (K): Strong stem growth, movement of water in plants, promotion of flowering and fruiting</p>

            <h1>PESTICIDES</h1>
            <h3>What is Pesticides?</h3>
            <p>Pesticides are substances that are meant to control pests, including weeds.The term pesticide includes all of the following:
                herbicide, insecticides (which may include insect growth regulators, termiticides, etc.) nematicide, molluscicide, piscicide, 
                avicide, rodenticide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, and fungicide.The most common of these 
                are herbicides which account for approximately 80% of all pesticide use. Most pesticides are intended to serve as plant 
                protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general, protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects.</p>
            <h3>What is the need of pesticides?</h3>    
            <p>Pesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harmful. For example, they are used to kill mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like West Nile virus, yellow 
                fever, and malaria. They can also kill bees, wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals 
                from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas. Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused
                by moldy food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees, and brush. They can also kill invasive
                weeds that may cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as
                water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant. Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses. Pesticides are used in grocery stores and 
                food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk.
                Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies 
                such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada.</p>
